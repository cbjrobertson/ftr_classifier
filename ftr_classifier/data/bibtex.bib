@article{Byloo2007,
 abstract = {This contribution investigates the meanings and uses of the English and Dutch adverbs certainly and zeker. In the range of adverbial expressions of epistemic modality, the ‘strong' adverbs (expressing ‘certainty') clearly tend to be used in a much more ‘flexible' way than the (relatively) weaker ones, and this contribution is an attempt to get a better view of what this flexibility actually involves, on the basis of a careful analysis of corpus data. The comparative approach allows us to distinguish between features which are whims of a single language, and hence have little meaning beyond the grammar of that language, and features which reflect more profound issues in the analysis of the meanings at stake, and which therefore may reflect fundamental conceptual issues.},

This article uncov- ers the main restrictions on modal concord, as it is exemplified in Dutch, and surveys the recent literature on modal concord. Three possible analyses will be critically compared. First, a syntactic anal- ysis in terms of agreement, second a semantic analysis in terms of type-shifting, and finally, a semantic analysis according to which ad- verbs denote ordering sources. The comparison ultimately favors the last analysis. 1Introduction},

@article{Kirsner1970,
 abstract = {Traditional grammars of Modern Standard Dutch teach that zullen is the 'auxiliary verb of the future tense'. In spite of the dissatisfaction of such linguists as A. W. de Groot and F. G. Droste, the exact meaning of zullen and the precise mechanism by which it can function as a future auxiliary remain to be elucidated. C.I. Ebeling's recent discussion, though containing valuable suggestions, constitutes no final solution. It is proposed here that the use of zullen in Modern Standard Dutch follows from its membership, together with the forms moeten and kunnen, in a system which characterizes occurences as hypothetical rather than real. Because zullen - in contrast to the other elements of the system - does not specify the degree of likelihood of the event in question, it may be interpreted as signaling futurity, inference, command, or the intention of the speaker. The particular messages transmitted with zullen in specific instances are conclusions drawn from the interaction of its own meaning with the particular member of the tense system with it is combined and with observable factors in the extra-linguistic context. Seen in this framework, the textbook functions of zullen, both as a 'modal auxiliary' and as a 'future auxiliary' illustrate the following principle: the language user will favor that member of a closed system of semantic oppositions whose meaning is least inappropriate to a given message. ?? 1969.},

 abstract = {Language plays an important role in politics and culture influences the use of language. Therefore, are cultural differences reflected in the language used by politicians? This question was the basis for our research, which focused on the use of epistemic modality (the expression of certainty) in political speeches in the European parliament. Specifically, our research question was: “Are there (national or party political) cultural differences in the use of modal adverbs and dismissive adjectives?” The research was conducted by counting the number of times modal adverbs (sure and unsure) and dismissive adjectives were used in speeches by English, Dutch and Belgian politicians in the European parliament. These results were analyzed according to country, political party differences and word type. Ultimately, we found that populist parties stand out in their use of epistemic modality, especially in their use of dismissive adjectives. Between the other political parties there is no clear trend or correlation for all three word categories - dismissive, sure, and unsure - in all three countries. Further research, for example with a larger database, looking at different ways of expressing epistemic modality or taking into account factors such as individual party properties may result in different conclusions.},

The term "modality" is taken to refer to just those (four) domains in which possibility contrasts with necessity, and "semantic map' refers to a representation of cross-linguistically relevant synchronic and diachronic connections between modal, premodal, and post- modal meanings or uses. Special attention is given to meanings that are vague between possibility and necessity, to developments from possibility to necessity and vice versa, to postmodal meanings that can originale in either possibility or necessity, and to demodalization of non-epistemic modality.},
