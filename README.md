# ftr_classifier
This branch of the `ftr-classifier` is designed to be used on naturally-occuring data, rather than experimental data like the `master` branch. The main difference is that the present tense category does not rely on word lists; it rather simply classes all statements which are not classified as any other category as present tense. 

The other main addiion is the ability to classify text data in terms of not only _how_ but _whether_ test data refer to the future. 

See the `README.md` to the `master` branch for documentation.
